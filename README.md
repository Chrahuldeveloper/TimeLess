# TimeLess ⏳📱

TimeLess is an **AR (Augmented Reality) Web application** that lets users experience history in real time.

By pointing their phone camera at a **real historical monument**, the app replaces the present-day structure with a **3D reconstruction of how it looked in the past**, while keeping the **real-world surroundings unchanged**.

---

## 🏛️ What TimeLess Does

* Uses the device camera to detect a historical monument
* Overlays a **past-era 3D model** of the monument in real-world scale
* Keeps the live camera background intact for realism
* Allows users to visually time-travel and explore history

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 📷 **Real-Time AR View** – Seamless camera-based augmented reality
* 🏗️ **Historical 3D Reconstructions** – Accurate models of monuments from the past
* 🌍 **Context-Preserved Environment** – Only the monument changes, not the surroundings
* 🎓 **Educational Experience** – Learn history visually, not just through text

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User opens the TimeLess app
2. Points the camera at a supported historical monument
3. The app recognizes the monument
4. A **3D model of the monument from a specific historical era** replaces the current structure
5. User explores the monument as it existed in the past
